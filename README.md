# Hosting HQ i18n
## What is this
This repo contains the strings for the Hosting HQ Website and its corresponding translations

## How can I provide a translation?
Anyone can provide a translation, follow the following steps:
1. Copy/Fork this repository
2. Copy the contents of the `en-US` file into your new translation file
3. Translate the string values (not the names) to your language [If you are unable to translate some, leave them in English so someone else can translate them later]
4. Save the new file with the language code and country code as a JSON file (e.g Lang=`en`, Country=`US` would be `en-US.json`
5. Submit a pull request to this repository **OR** visit our Discord server and provide the JSON file to us directly

## I see an inaccurate translation, can I fix it?
Yes! Follow steps 1-4 above, and visit our Discord server and provide the JSON file to us directly so we can update the live site if needed.
